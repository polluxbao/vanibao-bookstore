				Situated on an oasis of green in the Borough of Saint-Laurent, of the City of Montreal, 
				Vanier College occupies property and buildings purchased by the government from the Soeurs de Sainte-Croix who previously operated a convent (Couvent Notre-Dame-des-Anges) and a private women's college (Collège Basile-Moreau) in the location.
